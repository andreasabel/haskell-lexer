This program is used to generate the lexer used by the haskell-lexer package.
To modify the lexer:
  1. modify the modules in the "Spec" sub-directory as neccessary,
  2. recompile and run the generator,
  3. replace the module Language.Haskell.Lexer.Lex with the new code.

NOTE:  The module Language.Haskell.Lexer.Tokens is shared between this program
and the haskell-lexer library.  The current setup assumes that the source
for this library is in the parent directory.
